## General Information

#### Business Problem
Lending club is a consumer finance company providing loan to urban customers. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). They need to identify these risky loan applicants to reduce their credit loss  
#### Objective

The company can utilize this knowledge for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
#### Dataset
Complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
